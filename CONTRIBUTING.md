# Contributing to the Community Master List

First off, thank you for considering contributing! 🚀

The goal of this repository is to build the most accurate and comprehensive database of **Mod Translations** for the community. By sharing your local list, you help other users automatically find the correct translations for their mods based on precise Hash Matching.

## ⚠️ Important Rule

**Do not edit files in the `database/` folder directly.**
All new data must be submitted to the `submissions/` folder. Our automated scripts will validate, merge, and move the data to the main database safely.

## 📝 How to Contribute (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: In the App (NexLocalizer)

1.  Open the **Mod Translation Manager (NexLocalizer)**.
2.  Make sure your mod list is organized and linked correctly.
    * *Tip: If you manually corrected a version or link, the app will prioritize your fix.*
3.  Click the **"Export List"** button in the main interface.
4.  Save the `.json` file to your computer.
    * *The app automatically removes personal metadata, so it is safe to share.*

Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this page. This creates a copy of this repository in your own GitHub account.

#### 2. Upload your File
1.  Go to your forked repository.
2.  Open the **`submissions/`** folder.
3.  Click **"Add file"** > **"Upload files"**.

5.  Commit the changes (click the green "Commit changes" button).

#### 3. Open a Pull Request (PR)

## ✅ What happens next?

1.  **Automated Validation:** A GitHub Action will automatically run to check if your JSON file is valid (no syntax errors).
2.  **Review:** We will review your submission.
3.  **Merge:** Once approved, we run a script that merges your data into the main Master List.
    * *Note: We use a "Smart Merge" system. If you submit data for a mod that already exists, we prioritize data that includes Hash verification.*

## ❌ What NOT to submit

* Do not submit files generated by other tools.
* Do not manually edit the JSON unless you know exactly what you are doing (syntax errors will block your PR).
* Do not upload copyrighted game files (ESPs, BSAs), only the `.json` metadata file.

Thank you for helping the community! 🌍
